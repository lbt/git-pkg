This tools supports managing rpm packaging (spec files and patches) from a git tree.

Why is it needed?
#################

The rpm packaging used in Mer and derived products consists of a tarball and some packaging files. These packages need to be change controlled and that is where problems arise.

Currently for Mer Core the raw tarball[1], patches and packaging files are stored in git.

This leads to:
* inefficient storage: git is not designed to store large binaries efficiently
* opacity: files in the tarball cannot be examined without extracting and unpacking
* dissociation: the upstream change history is lost

So clearly the objectives are:
* increase storage efficiency
* reduce opacity
* retain association with upstream
also
* maintain or improve RE efficiency
* obviousness - eg "git checkout master" should have me ready to hack

For a distro/product there are 2 types of package: native and upstream: upstream may contain additional patches, native doesn't. gitpkg is useful for both upstream and native packages and ensures that packaging is kept distinct from the code.

Upstream code is distributed in many 

The tool assumes that OBS is not being used as the primary store for code and packaging.

Notes:

* The tarball uses src/ as the location for git packages unless pristine-tar is in use

What does it do?
################

There are 2 main uses:
 * create tarball, spec and patches for building/uploading to OBS
 * setup existing packages into a suitable git tree

Normal Operation
################

Assuming a working package that needs changing.

Link the git and osc directories: typically go to the osc co directory:
  rm *
  ln -s /path/to/package/.git .git   # (Should this be a local clone?)
  gp_mkpkg

Now do an osc build to prepare the build environment

  osc build

Work in the git code tree and use local osc build and quickbuild to get the code working.

  git checkout <code branch>

Once all code is correct, tag it and checkout the pkg branch

Edit the _src file to update the tag for the patches and/or the tarball

Generate the patches files:
  gp_mkpkg

(FIXME: This needs to support --update-spec and --update-yaml)

Now edit the .spec file and update the Version: Release: (and Patches:/%build)

Edit the .changes file
FIXME: suggest some changes by parsing the git log)

Add changes to git packaging branch (some operations may need more care)
  git add *spec *changes _src

Then commit and push
  git commit -s
  git push ....

Examples

acl : upstream tarball
build : upstream git
mer-gfx-tests : native git
rpm : upstream git + autoconf code in released tarball


Using gp_setup
##############

This can be used to simply create a suitable packaging branch or to import existing packaging.

The TLDR answer:

  gp_setup --existing --pristine --base=RELEASE_0_9_7 --pkgdir=/mer/obs/cobs/Project:KDE:Mer_Extras/oprofile --patch-branch=0.9.7

Worked Example: Importing oprofile
##################################

Upstream uses git so we'll use --base to base off it after cloning it:
  git clone git://oprofile.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/oprofile/oprofile
  cd oprofile

Determine the tag and verify if a pristine-tar should also be used (eg for autogen.sh)

We have some packaging so check it out (in a different window):
  osc co Project:KDE:Mer_Extras oprofile
so we can use --existing

Looking at the tarball there are changes to the git tree (autogen.sh etc) so we'll use --pristine

The release tag is "RELEASE_0_9_7" so that will be the --base value; we'll also have a patch-branch of 0.9.7 which we can make Mer release tags on if we add patches.

The command then is:

  gp_setup --existing --pristine --base=RELEASE_0_9_7 --pkgdir=/mer/obs/cobs/Project:KDE:Mer_Extras/oprofile --patch-branch=0.9.7


More examples:

Project with an upstream git and some existing packaging

  git clone upstream
  gp_setup --existing --base=v3.1.7 --pkgdir=/mer/obs/cobs/Mer:Tools:Testing/pciutils/ --patch-branch=v3.1.7-3

Project with an upstream git, a pristine tar and some existing packaging

  git clone upstream
  gp_setup --existing --pristine --base=v3.1.7 --pkgdir=/mer/obs/cobs/Mer:Tools:Testing/pciutils/ --patch-branch=v3.1.7-3

Project with no upstream git a pristine tar and some existing packaging but no patches ##FIXME##
  git init
  gp_setup --existing --pristine --unpack=/mer/obs/cobs/home:auke/xdelta

Project with no upstream git a pristine tar and some existing packaging with patches
  git init
  gp_setup --existing --pristine --unpack=/mer/obs/cobs/Mer:Tools:Testing/tcl --base=
(needs tags for master and for mer-branch --unpack=<tag>)



Git Names and branch layouts
############################

ver is X.Y.Z and is conceptually an upstream version and ideally a tag.

X.Y.Z-R is the mer version/tag


upstream/ : upstream or master branch (can be anything - often a specific
master	    branch with rc releases eg in rpm or OBS)

mer-<ver> : mer branch per upstream release (re-created based on each
	    upstream release). Initial commit is the pristine-tar
	    delta. Subsequent commits are patches. Tags are made on
	    here to preserve commits and the branch may be re-based if
	    needed (eg if a patch is removed between -1 and -2
	    releases)
	    Tags here will be of the form mer-X.Y.Z-R

pkg-mer :   Discrete commit tree holding any packaging.
	    Tags of pkg-mer-X.Y.Z-R


Git support for multiple sources is possible but complex


The _src file
#############

This file defines the src needed for building a package.
It supports:

* Single tarball
* Patches
* Multiple tarballs (yes, kinda, see obs-server)

One line:
* git:<tarball>:<commit1>:<commit2>
* pristine-tar:<tarball>:<commit1>:<commit2>
* Future? Blob : if needed, just store the raw file in a commit

git:<filename>:<commit1>[:<commit2>]
    <filename> is created in the current directory from git archive at <commit>
    patches for commits from <commit1> to <commit2> are placed in files
    according to git-patch

pristine-tar:<filename>[:<commit1>:<commit2>] <filename> is extracted
    from pristine-tar <commit1> represents the closest point on the
    upstream branch to the pristine tar. At this point there's a mer
    branch. The first commit is a simple patch of any files added,
    modified or removed to make the released tarball. Subsequent
    patches are Mer's
    Patches for commits from <commit1> to <commit2> are placed in files
    according to git-patch. THE FIRST COMMIT IS SKIPPED as it's
    in the pristine tarball.
    The filename is obtained from pristine-tar checkout

Notes:

gitpkg uses git orphan branches. See   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1384325/in-git-is-there-a-simple-way-of-introducing-an-unrelated-branch-to-a-repository
